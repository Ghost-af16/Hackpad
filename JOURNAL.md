## 10/23/2025 - THE LAST AND FIRST UPDATE !  

Hey Fellas ! 
This was my first time working upon a Blueprint Project so i didn't knew that i need to upload a journal after each work i do on this project as i thought that i would need to just ship a project with the total number of hours and the repo link ... I admit this mistake and hereafter won't repeat this in my next project .

HOWEVER THE MAIN JOURLAING CAN BE FOUND IN MY GITHUB REPO .. ![Screenshot 2025-10-23 013758.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUzMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--baced6280a0c51d1d6b62004079f8a9570ba148d/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20013758.png)
